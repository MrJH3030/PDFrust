# PDFrust
Simple command line tool which allows to merge pdf documents and select specific pages. I made this to be able to merge private documents without having to upload them to a random website. 


## Commands
- merge [directly merge two documents]
- browse [browse your files in the terminal and merge as many as you want]
- delete [remove pages from a document]
- --help


Development is still in progess
